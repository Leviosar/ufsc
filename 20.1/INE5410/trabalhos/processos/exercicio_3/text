Bone forks have been found in archaeological sites of the Bronze Age Qijia culture (2400–1900 BC), the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–c. 1050 BC), as well as later Chinese dynasties [1]. 
A stone carving from an Eastern Han tomb (in Ta-kua-liang, Suide County, Shaanxi) depicts three hanging two-pronged forks in a dining scene [1].
Conversely, similar forks has also been depicted on top of a stove in a scene at another Eastern Han tomb (in Suide County, Shaanxi) [1]. In Ancient Egypt, large forks were used as cooking utensils [2].

In the Roman Empire, bronze and silver forks were used, many surviving examples of which are displayed in museums around Europe [3][4].
Use varied according to local customs, social class, and the type of food, but in earlier periods forks were mostly used as cooking and serving utensils.

Although its origin may go back to Ancient Greece, the personal table fork was most likely invented in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, where they were in common use by the 4th century [5][6].
Records show that by the 9th century in some elite circles of Persia a similar utensil known as a barjyn was in limited use [7]. 
By the 10th century, the table fork was in common use throughout the Middle East.[2]
