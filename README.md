# UFSC - Academic repository

I've decided to share my notes, books, exercises and projects used in my computer science graduation at UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina). This repository will grow a lot with time and i hope it can help some other students.

I'll try to maintain a updated index on this readme but you know, sometimes it's just hard to have time for it. Oh, also i started this repo after my first semester so i only have materials from after that.
